# nexus-report-plugin

Download a statistics report of your repositories.

## Build
You don't need to build the code to install the plugin, you can find the .kar file in the last release.

If you want to build the plugin by yourself, you need somes front components from nexus-ui-plugin.
The easier way is to checkout the <a href="https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-public">nexus-public</a> repository and copy nexus-report-plugin in the `nexus-public/plugins/` folder.
After this you can run the command `mvn clean install -PbuildKar` in nexus-report-plugin.

An issue (<a href="https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/DX-112">DX-112</a>) was opened to put the nexus-ui-plugins front components on Yarn registry. Like this, the nexus-report-plugin can be build independently of the nexus-public.

## Installation
Copy the .kar file generated by the build in the `deploy/` folder of your Nexus server and restart the server.

## Permission
The users need the **"nx-report-download"** permission to perform this action.
You can create a new role with it or add it to an existing one.
Of course, an administrator have this permission by default.

## Usage
If one of yours roles have the permission "nx-report-download", you should see a **"Report"** button (1) on the left side menu.
When you click on it a list of your granted repositories will be displayed. You have the possibility to sort it (2) or filter it (3) with the field at the top-right.
When you click on a repository of the list, it will download the report associated to this repository.
